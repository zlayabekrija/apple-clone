## üçé Clone

This project is the collaboration of [Zlatan](https://github.com/zlayabekrija) & [Inzi](https://github.com/inhaq).[Preview this project ]( https://zlayabekrija.github.io/apple-clone/).

To enhance and practive our HTML5/CSS3 knowledge, we cloned design of older version of apple website. In the process we improved our collaboration skills, learned floats, positioning, box model, layout.

We started with image as a background and added header with relative position. For titles below header we used images and used them as sprites with hover. Below that we added four images with setting float left. After that we added footer.
